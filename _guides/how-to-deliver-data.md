title: How to deliver data to the ALA
---

You are an institution which wishes to deliver data to the Atlas of
Living Australia, but you want to do so in a manner that is consistent
with the other institutions around the country who also deliver data.

# Delivery format

Data should be delivered as either:

- A Simple Darwin Core CSV
- A Darwin Core Archive

The ALA have stated that they have a preference for simple Darwin Core
CSV files.

# How to deliver

Talk to the ALA to establish the optimal way that your institution can
deliver data to them. 

# What to deliver

## Data completeness

THIS HAS NEVER BEEN FORMALLY AGREED

What is the minimum amount of data that should be present for a
specimen record to be useful? Is a collection of "a fish" from a
specified location still useful? Is a specimen of _Camponotus
suffusus_ still useful if nobody knows from where it was collected?
What if the collection location is known but the time of the
collection can't be narrowed down further than "Early 1900s"?

### Mandatory

This is the minimum required for a record to be of use to anyone

- Some metadata

	Allowing for some examination of the validity of the information
	
- A registration number

	This allows the item to be physically located in a collection
	
- An identification 

	This allows for the user to know if the item is of interest
	
- A collection location

	This allows for further refinement of the item
	
- Type Status

	Whether a specimen is a type is of fundamental importance

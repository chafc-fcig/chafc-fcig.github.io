# Collection Codes

Different institutions call their collections different things within
their internal collections databases. This is a listing of these
different collection names.

These codes are particular relevent for the delivery of tissue
samples, to ensure that the voucher record is easily accessible from
the tissue record

*Currently these codes have been taken from the SAMA tissues database
and may not be correct*

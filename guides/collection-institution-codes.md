# Collection Codes

Different institutions call their collections different things within
their internal collections databases. This is a listing of these
different collection names.

These codes are particular relevant for the delivery of tissue
samples, to ensure that the voucher record is easily accessible from
the tissue record

These codes were initially compiled from the SA Museum's tissue data which has been enhanced by other institutions. So there may be a bit of drift from current practice. Please let me know.

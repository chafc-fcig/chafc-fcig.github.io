:warning: this site is in the early stages of writing so please don't rely on anything here :warning:

You are an institution which wishes to deliver data to the
Atlas of Living Australia, but you want to do so in a manner
that is consistent with the other institutions around the
country who also deliver data.

# Delivery format

Data should be delivered as either:

- A Simple Darwin Core CSV
- A Darwin Core Archive

# Data Completion

:warning: THIS HAS NEVER BEEN FORMALLY AGREED :warning:

*_This is what should be used to construct the queries used to select records to send_.*

What is the minimum amount of data that should be present for
a specimen record to be useful? 

Is a collection of "a fish" from a specified location still
useful? Is a specimen of _Camponotus suffusus_ still useful if
nobody knows from where it was collected? What if the
collection location is known but the time of the collection
can't be narrowed down further than "Early 1900s"?  

The following is the absolute minimum amount of data that should be present for an institution to send the record. Note that there is other information which is mandatory to deliver.



## Mandatory minimum amount of data

### Registration details

- A registration number unique in the institution.

### An identification

- The taxon

  All specimens which have been identified to species level.
  
  The minimum level of certainty required depends on the taxon group and is at the discretion of the Institution. For example a Mammal only identified to Class level is probably useless but a mite only identified to Class level but from a known area could be of great interest to a researcher.

### Collection Information

- Country
- State 
- Textual description of the location.
  
- Latitude
- Longitude 

### Type Status 

- For all type specimens, the type status and the type taxon

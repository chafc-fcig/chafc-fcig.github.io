The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The documents
are written using [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

The Guides are in the folder called _guides

Note that the fields guides are partly generated automatically from
the csv files containing the lists of fields which are in the folder called
_data. This allows (in theory) for easier updating and changing of things.

The Discussions are in the folder called _discussions.

The "work in progress" sign is in the file
`_includes/in_progress.html` and added to all pages in
`_layouts/default.html`

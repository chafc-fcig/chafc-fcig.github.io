# About FCIG

FCIG, the Faunal Council Informatics Group is a group of
people from the Museums around Australia which hold
significant collections of biological specimens. 

We are concerned with all aspects of faunal collection data
but in particular we work with the Atlas of Living Australia
to promote the aggregation and use of Australian biological
specimen data.

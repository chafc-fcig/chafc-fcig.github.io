The Faunal Council Informatics Group is a group of people from the
Museums around Australia which hold significant collections of
biological specimens. 

We are concerned with all aspects of faunal collection data but in
particular we work with the Atlas of Living Australia to promote the
use of Australian biological specimen data.

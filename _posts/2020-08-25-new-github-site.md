The old PBWorks site served us well for many years but is a bit clunky
to use for the preparation of documentation. Hopefully this GitHub
site will be more straightforward.

As it is a github pages site authorised users can either edit the files locally
or online on github pages.

For authorised users (i.e. members of FCIG) I'm assuming that if you
want to edit GitHub files locally you are familiar with how to do
that. To edit files online go to [this site's repository](
https://github.com/chafc-fcig/chafc-fcig.github.io), navigate to the
file you want to edit and select the edit button (pencil icon) on the
right-hand-side. Edit using [GitHub Flavoured
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/),
then at the bottom of the page enter a short description of what you
did and click Commit Changes.
